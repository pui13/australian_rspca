The RSPCA is Australia’s oldest, largest and most trusted animal welfare organisation. With this privileged position comes great responsibility. This year we received1 124,146 animals into our animal shelters and adoption centres across the country.

With a great deal of effort from RSPCAs all over the country, adoption and reclaiming rates nationally have been increasing over time and significant improvements in the outcomes for cats and dogs (including kittens and puppies) have been achieved. This can be attributed to the introduction of new approaches and programs to increase the number of animals adopted and reunited with their owners.

# Questions of Potential Interest


We have data on the different types of wildlife injuries in our database. Below are some ideas we would be intersted in.  

* Is there are a trend in injuries By Region, and is there different peaks of times of year per region? 
* Analysis on the types of animals that are injured, this also by Region – is there a species that is more liable to injury in certain regions?
* What is the outcome? Does this differ by region?  

* Total call volume for complaint calls: How has this trended over time?  
* Is there a particular animal being called about the most?  
* Do particular suburbs have different type of complaint calls? Do they call about different animals? 

* Business Intelligence – using the insights you have found, can you predict how this might look for the upcoming year?
